# How To Use:
Just Run the "mailer.py" file with python3 :wink:
<br>
Use this command in the terminal.

If you are in windows and python3 is set as the active python version then the following command will suffice.

`python mailer.py`

The crawled email addresses will appear in the "Emails" folder. The filename will be the same as your search-keyword.

If it doesn't work and throw error with Chromedriver, that means the chromedriver I have provided and the chrome version you have doesn't match. try downloading a chromedriver from the same version range of chrome that you have.
